/**
KVO is a tricky mechanism.

When observing child in a ownership hierarchy, usually retaining observing target is wanted behavior.
When observing parent in a ownership hierarchy, usually retaining target isn't wanter behavior.

KVO with weak references is especially tricky. For it to work, some kind of swizzling is required.
That can be done by
    * replacing object class dynamically (like KVO does)
    * by swizzling `dealloc` method on all instances for a class.
    * some third method ...

Both approaches can fail in certain scenarios:
    * problems arise when swizzlers return original object class (like KVO does when nobody is observing)
    * Problems can arise because replacing dealloc method isn't atomic operation (get implementation,
    set implementation).

Second approach is chosen. It can fail in case there are multiple libraries dynamically trying
to replace dealloc method. In case that isn't the case, it should be ok.
